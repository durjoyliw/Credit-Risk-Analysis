# Credit Risk Analysis: Optimizing Lending Decisions Through Data-Driven Risk Assessment

**Role:** Data Analyst (Risk Management Team)  
**Business Context:** In competitive lending markets, loan defaults directly impact profitability and portfolio health. This analysis identifies high-risk borrower segments and provides actionable recommendations to reduce default rates while maintaining loan accessibility.

---

## Executive Summary

**Bottom Line:** By implementing recommended risk thresholds, we can potentially **reduce default rates by 45%** while maintaining 82% loan approval rates for qualified borrowers.

**Key Finding:** Borrowers with loan-to-income ratios above 31% show a **70% default rate** compared to 25% below this threshold - making this our strongest risk predictor.

## Next Steps for Analysis

To refine these recommendations further, I recommend investigating:

1. **Geographic Risk Patterns:** Are certain regions showing elevated default rates?
2. **Seasonal Trends:** Do defaults spike during specific months/quarters?
3. **Loan Purpose Analysis:** Deeper dive into medical vs. education loan performance
4. **Customer Lifetime Value:** Compare default risk against potential long-term profitability

## Technical Approach

**Tools Used:** Python (pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn, XGBoost)  
**Dataset:** [Kaggle Credit Risk Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/laotse/credit-risk-dataset) (32,581 records, 12 features)

### Data Cleaning & Preprocessing

**Handling Missing Values:**

- **person_emp_length:** 2.7% missing - dropped due to low percentage

<img width="436" alt="missing-values-emp" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/54c639ff-1d5a-4aca-b75a-59f29e97c458">

- **loan_int_rate:** 9.5% missing - imputed based on loan_grade to preserve data quality

<img width="598" alt="missing-values-interest" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7530985b-458d-4c7c-a218-e668d8c33486">

**Feature Engineering:**

Created **has_income_no_emp** flag to identify self-employed or new workers:

<img width="516" alt="feature-engineering" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/09c86192-309a-4733-9e8f-0d9fec88c6f5">

Binned age groups and income ranges for segment analysis:

<img width="307" alt="clean-data-export" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8eaa4a27-0ecc-48da-b3a6-366d90cf016b">

### Advanced Feature Engineering

Created composite risk score combining multiple financial factors:

<img width="730" alt="composite-risk-score" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/535b2fbd-f646-4622-9e2d-fe9d5ea7daff">

**Risk Score Components:**
- Loan interest rate
- Loan grade  
- Income percentage
- Home ownership status
- Prior default history

All factors mapped to numerical values and scaled using MinMaxScaler, then categorized into four risk levels: Low, Medium, High, and Very High.

### Methodology

1. **Data Cleaning:** Handled 9.5% missing values, removed outliers, engineered 3 new features
2. **Exploratory Analysis:** Univariate, bivariate, and multivariate analysis to identify risk patterns
3. **Threshold Discovery:** Established 31% loan-to-income and 15.4% interest rate thresholds through statistical analysis
4. **Model Building:** Trained and compared 5 classification algorithms (Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, KNN, XGBoost)
5. **Model Selection:** Chose XGBoost (recall) and Random Forest (precision) based on business needs

**Challenges Overcome:**
- Managed imbalanced dataset (78% non-defaulters)
- Avoided bias when imputing missing interest rates
- Validated correlation insights through multivariate analysis

## About This Analysis

This project demonstrates how data analytics can directly inform lending strategy and risk management decisions. By focusing on actionable insights rather than just model accuracy, this analysis provides a framework for making data-driven lending decisions that balance risk mitigation with market competitiveness.

**Key Takeaway:** Feature engineering and business-focused analysis are more valuable than complex algorithms. Understanding *why* borrowers default enables better policy decisions than simply predicting *who* will default.
